\section{Vulnerability Training}

This last section will talk about some other related work I had to undertake, mostly trainings about known vulnerabilities and how to inject it into real software.

In preparation for the manual injection of real-world vulnerabilities in production software, my industrial mentors asked me to learn about well-known vulnerabilities. They challenged me with various safe code fragments and asked me to tweak the code to seed vulnerabilities in it.

Listings \ref{lst:unflawed-code} and \ref{lst:flawed-code} serve as an example where I modified a small C code fragment to make it vulnerable. By removing the size check on \emph{argv[1]}, there is no guarantee that it will not exceed the fixed size allocated heap memory, theregore causing an overflow.
