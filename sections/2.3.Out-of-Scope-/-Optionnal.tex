\section{Out of Scope / Optional}

My mission was not to develop or improve static analyzers. It focused on finding solutions, methods, envisioned for the creation of high quality \gls{vulnerability} test suites. I did not work \emph{per se} on static analyzers, although I had the opportunity to run Frama-C \cite{frama2016c} and Fortify \cite{hewlett2016fortify}, two static analyzers, to perform series of tests on existing bugs corpora.
