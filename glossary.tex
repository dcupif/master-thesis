\newglossaryentry{ai}
{
  name=abstract interpretation,
  description={Abstract interpretation is a sound approximation technique of the semantics of a computer program}
}

\newglossaryentry{gls-ast}
{
  name=abstract syntaxic tree,
  description={\Glspl{ast} are simplified versions of their corresponding syntaxic trees, designed to be more suitable for further analysis},
  plural=abstract syntaxic trees
}

\newglossaryentry{cp}
{
  name=constant propagation,
  description={Constant Propagation is a dataflow analysis technique that consists in replacing by its value all uses of an SSA variable that has been assigned a constant value}
}

\newglossaryentry{fn}
{
    name=false negative,
    description={
        A real problem in a program that is not reported by the tool \cite{chess2007secure}
    },
    plural=false negatives
}

\newglossaryentry{fp}
{
    name=false positive,
    description={
        A problem reported in a program when no problem actually exists \cite{chess2007secure}
    },
    plural=false positives
}

\newglossaryentry{mc}
{
    name=model checking,
    description={Model checking is a technique that transforms a given specification, also called model, into a finite state automaton. It converts the program to be analyzed into a finite state automaton as well, and it compares the specification to the model \cite{chess2007secure}}
}

\newglossaryentry{mutant}
{
    name=mutant,
    description={
        A mutant is a slightly modified version of an original piece of software that has been processed through mutation analysis.
    }
}

\newglossaryentry{se}
{
    name=symbolic execution,
    description={
        The symbolic execution of a program refers to the process of simulating an execution with abstract values rather than concrete ones \cite{anderson2008use}. This approach is based on \gls{ai} and \gls{mc}
    }
}

\newglossaryentry{gls-ssa}
{
    name=static single assignment,
    description={
        \gls{ssa} is a dataflow analysis method that restricts functions to assign a value to a variable only once \cite{chess2007secure}.
    }
}

\newglossaryentry{tp}
{
    name=taint propagation,
    description={
         Taint propagation is a technique which allows to determine from where data comes from by labeling all the input bytes, and propagating those labels following the execution of a program
    }
}

{
    name=vulnerability,
    description={
        \Gls{weakness} in system security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls whe\-reby an entity can successfully violate a systemâ€™s security (accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited) and result in a security breach or a violation of the system's security policy \cite{okun2016sate}
